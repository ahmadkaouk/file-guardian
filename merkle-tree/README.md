GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's an example README for the `merkle-tree` package:

# Merkle Tree

A Rust implementation of a Merkle Tree data structure.

The Merkle Tree struct that can be instantiated with any Hasher type that implements the `Hashe`r trait. The Merkle Tree is represented as a binary tree where each leaf node represents a data block and each non-leaf node represents a hash of its children nodes. 

## Usage

Add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` file to use the `merkle-tree` package:

```toml
merkle-tree = "0.1.0"
```

Then, add the following line to your Rust file to import the `MerkleTree` type:

```rust
use merkle_tree::MerkleTree;
```

You can create a new Merkle Tree from a vector of data using the `new` method:

```rust
let data = vec!["hello", "world"].iter().map(|s| s.as_bytes().to_vec()).collect();
let tree = MerkleTree::new::<Sha256Hasher>::(&data).unwrap();
```

You can get the root hash of the tree using the `root` method:

```rust
let root_hash = tree.root().unwrap();
println!("Root hash: {:?}", root_hash);
```

You can also get a proof for a specific leaf node using the `proof` method:

```rust
let proof = tree.proof(0).unwrap();
println!("Proof for leaf 0: {:?}", proof);
```

## Examples

Here's an example of how to use the `merkle-tree` package to verify the integrity of a file:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{BufReader, Read};
use merkle_tree::{MerkleTree, Sha256Hasher};

// Read the file into a buffer
let mut file = BufReader::new(File::open("file.txt").unwrap());
let mut buffer = Vec::new();
file.read_to_end(&mut buffer).unwrap();

// Compute the Merkle Tree of the file data
let tree = MerkleTree::<Sha256Hasher>::new(&buffer).unwrap();

// Verify the integrity of the file against a known root hash
let root_hash = hex::decode("0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef").unwrap();
let proof = tree.proof(0).unwrap();
assert!(proof.verify(&Sha256Hasher::hash(&buffer), &root_hash));
```

This example reads the contents of a file into a buffer, computes the Merkle Tree of the file data using SHA-256 as the hash function, and verifies the integrity of the file against a known root hash. The `hex` crate is used to decode the root hash from a hex string.
